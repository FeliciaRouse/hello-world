# hello-world
learning how to use Github 
I am new to programming and I want to understand how it works and how I can make it work for me. Learning how to progrom/code is my answer to working smart not hard.  To be able to take an idea and automate it or to create something that will allow people who have limitations or limited undersatnding to the IoT to be able to do tedious tasks simplier appeals to me.
